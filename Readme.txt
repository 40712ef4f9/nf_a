# Random Information
#####

* Mod-Config-Setting
the Config is available InGame by calling a Police-Chief (5-8 as far available, most sectors have one you need to find the zone he is waiting)

* NPC-Station-Building and Invasions can be disabled and this is default at the Plot-Start, so do better not enable by ourself, this will be started at the right time

* EWS (EarlyWarningSystem)
EWS have levels: 
- level 1: will always warning if at least one enemy military xl or l ship is present in a zone which player have a capitalship or station
- level 2: 50% chance for 1 enemy capship present and 100% chance when 2 or more enemy capship are present (the default now) 
- level 3: 33% for 1 enemy capship present, 50% when 2 enemy capship are present, 100% chance when 3 or more are present 
- level 4: 25% for 1 enemy capship present, 50% for 2 enemy capship present, 75% when 3 enemy capship is present and 100% when 4 or more enemy capship is present 
- EWS_Level cutoff: the minimum number of enemy ships to trigger EWS. So, you can have EWS to level 4 but a cutoff of 1. It will works with chances as above but only for 2 or more enemy units and so on. Can be set by config.

* Jumpdrive
you can configure jumpbehavior of ships in the mod-setting, there are the levels
- vanilla
- through gates (ship will jump instead of fly, based on skills)
- advanced (if skills are high enough the ship can jump directly into targetzone)

* it is also the cheat-option to disable fuelcell consume of playerowned ships available, so no extra mod is required (feel free to use, or not)

* beside of classic scan and smalltalk all stations, you can build now a Commercial Center with the HoL-CV. The Manager will then searching for new Stations and Tradeupdates (default a CC will work with the whole Galaxy, this can be limited to the System it is build)

* by dropping a NavBeakon you can call a delivery service for Weaponplattforms and more

* Building own Shipyard and Unique Stations
	A CV can build also not predefined Stations, here you must first get the Station blueprint!
** get blueprint: You need a Architect (and in case a Engineer) at the Skunk, then you have a Conversation option (with the Architect) if you are docked at a Station (the Blueprint you want)
	-- at relation Member (>25) you get it for free
	-- at relation Friend, you need to pay a fee
	-- at relation neutral, you can steal the blueprint: but here you need a good skilled Architect and Engineer to have only a small chance, if your heist will discovered the station come hostile for up to 24h
** preset blueprint at a CV: 
	-- you need the CV (or more then one if you like) in your Squad at the local Zone. 
	-- Talk to your Skunk-Architect and select the Station you want to build (if you have blueprints), then set the Blueprint to all or only a selected CV.
	-- Use CV like always, with selection of a buildspot, or order to build at a Zone by talking to Architect - Then you can use the regular Stations the CV do build (top-left), or you can Order the "Special Blueprint" if preset (option left and right of menu) left-option build only the base Station as always, right will directly continue after each step and build the station up to max
