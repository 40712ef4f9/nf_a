This Complex is the latest in Plutarch technology boasting the most powerful Corvette and fighter class ships in all of Albion.</t>

		<t id="3">{20101,6201} {20106,1807}</t>
		<t id="4">The Sul Mobile Weapons Platform is a new variant of the Heavy Sul Capital ship. Using a similar design, this version of the Heavy Sul has been outfitted with anti capital ship weapons and can be used as a mobile weapon platform. It houses two fully armed and primed HIVI/MA Turrets.</t>

		<t id="5">{20101,6101} {20106,1803}</t>
		<t id="6">The Sul Typhoon Frigate is a newly designed variant on the popular Sul class of ships. Due to the increased use of drones, along with fighters, it has become necessary to develop a ship which can withstand swarms of these vehicles of war. The Sul Typhoon Frigate houses 8 HIT/MA turrets for longer range suppression and 8 Hailstorm turrets for short range suppression. These will make quick work of any enemy fighter or drone.</t>

		<t id="7">{20101,6101} {20106,1804}</t>
		<t id="8">The Sul Eclipse Frigate is another newly designed variant for the Sul class of ships. After the creation of the Sul Typhoon Frigate, Albion shipwrights felt the need to create other variations for use in any situation. This version houses 6 Jet/LR turrets designed for long range engagements.</t>

		<t id="9">{20101,6101} {20106,1802}</t>
		<t id="10">The Sul Arbiter Frigate is a highly maneuverable and powerful anti capital ship. It is designed for quick deployment and packs a serious punch. This ship is another variation of the Sul class of ships and is armed with 6 Astrobee launchers for maximum destruction.</t>

		<t id="11">{20101,8901} {20106, 1801}</t>
		<t id="12">The Lepton Armadillo Frigate is a variant of the Lepton transporter. While this ship was repurposed primarily for the role of an Anti fighter ship, it can hold its own against other frigates of similar class due to its complement of Astrobee launcher turrets. It is armed with 4 HIT/MA turrets, 4 Hailstorm turrets and 2 Astrobee Launcher turrets. This ship is also cheaper than other frigates of its class and a good number of these could easily act as a military deterrent but will need to be backed up with heavier firepower</t>

		<t id="13">{20101,4801} {20106,1101}</t>
		<t id="14">Due to a pro longed war with the Plutarch Mining Corporation, the Republic of Cantera was in serious need of firepower. With the alliance between the ROC and HOA factions, the ROC was able to obtain new technology in which to construct their ships. While, ultimately, they are confined to existing hull designs, the weapon load outs of their ships could now be outfitted with more powerful weaponry. The Succellus Vanguard Destroyer is the product of this.</t>

		<t id="15">Stromvok Arbalest</t>
		<t id="16">This ship has been refitted for the sole role of Capital ship destruction. Along with new weapon technology that was acquired from the HOA faction, the ROC has been able to develop new ships on existing hull structures that utilize this technology. This ship is equipped solely with Astrobee launchers for maximum explosive impact. </t>

		<t id="17">Stromvok {20106,1805}</t>
		<t id="18">Along with its' sister ship, the Arbalest Cruiser, this ship has been refitted from its' original Stromvok hull structure. This ship is a little more versatile than the Arbalest Cruiser but still packs a powerful punch. This ship is a very capable cruiser and complements the new Succellus Vanguard Destroyer.</t>

		<t id="19">Scaldis {20106,1809}</t>
		<t id="20">The Scaldis Battle Star is a new addition to the HOA fleet. The growing conflict has called for new and innovative ships to combat the PMC menace as well as the increasing threat of the Xenon. The Scaldis was already in use by the HOA as a heavily armed mining vessel and the hull has been refitted for military purposes.</t>

		<t id="21">Sennin {20106,1815}</t>
		<t id="22">The Sennin Frigate Raider is a pirate ship designed for quick attacks and as support for the larger Titurel. The Sennin is excellent for hit and run tactics and for raiding. Not only does it pack decent firepower, but it also has sufficent cargo holds for any enterprising pirate.</t>

		<t id="23">Sennin {20106,1101}</t>
		<t id="24">The Sennin Frigate Vanguard is a pirate ship designed to give pirates a little more firepower with great maneuverability and excellent anti fighter capability at close range. The Sennin Vanguard is excellent for hit and run tactics and for raiding. This ship is pretty heavily armed for its' class but still lacks in durability.</t>

		<t id="25">Sennin {20106,1806}</t>
		<t id="26">The Sennin Frigate Besieger is the pirates' attempt at ultimate firepower in a small package. This ship packs quite a punch but offers no real defense against fighters and it's small hull belies its achilles heel. This ship will hit hard, though, before it falls.</t>

		<t id="27">Pirate Capital Shipyard</t>
		<t id="28">The Pirate Capital Shipyard is a Pirate version of other Shipyards. It can build Titurels, Sennin Frigates and all miners.</t>

		<t id="29">Pirate Tech Ship Complex</t>
		<t id="30">The Pirate Tech Ship Complex is not only produces ships but the resources to build them.</t>

		<t id="31">Pirate Dockyard </t>
		<t id="32">The Pirate Dockyard is completely focused on the building of Pirate ships for the Armada.</t>

		<t id="33">PMC Xenon Dockyard</t>
		<t id="34">The PMC Xenon Dockyard produces ships which utilize Xenon technology as well as producing other standard freighters and miners. This Dockyard is the latest in Plutarch technology boasting the most powerful Corvette and fighter class ships in all of Albion.</t>

		<t id="35">Chimera</t>
		<t id="36">The Chimera Battlecruiser a heavily outfitted Cruiser. This ship was designed to soften enemy defenses before the arrival of the much more powerful Behemoth destroyer.</t>

		<t id="37">Behemoth</t>
		<t id="38">The Behemoth Destroyer is the Heretic Vanguards answer to the AG Fulmekron. While it doesn't have the same firepower that the Fulmekron has, it makes up for this disadvantage with a stronger hull and more powerful shielding</t>

		<t id="39">Wraith</t>
		<t id="40">The Wraith Cruiser is a ship designed for escort roles. This ship is an excellent complement to the Chimera Battle Cruiser with its' anti-fighter guns. The ship is also outfitted with a few plasma turrets for ship to ship combat but should not be relied on for extensive ccmbat without more powerful ships.</t>

		<t id="41">Harpy</t>
		<t id="42">The Harpy Missile Cruiser is a powerful and fast long range ship useful for long range bombardment. The ship must be protected at all times as it has no anti-fighter weaponry and could be easily disabled without a proper escort.</t>

		<t id="43">Hades {20106,1808}</t>
		<t id="44">The Hades Super Carrier is a large carrier capable of carrying a swarm of attack drones.</t>

		<t id="45">Experimental Shipyard</t>
		<t id="46">The Experimental Shipyard has the capabilities to construct prototype ship designs which have not been released for mass production. These ships are powerful and expensive and still in need of extensive testing before they will see mass use</t>

		<t id="47">{40000,49} {20101,4001}</t>
		<t id="48">This Construction Vessel constructs specialized automated outposts used for command and control over territory. No resources are needed to construct the outpost as the CV itself is used in the construction process.</t>

		<t id="49">Outpost</t>
		<t id="50">The outpost is a very compact and sturdy structure, designed specially for autonomous maintenance of remote areas. Despite its size, it is very well armed and can survive under fire long enough for reinforcements to arrive.</t>

		<t id="51">X4-Probe</t>
		<t id="52">A fully automated fire and forget probe with advanced sensors that can detect and analyse objects in deep space far from its home base and can be used also as strategic jump beacon. This improved X4-Probe has its hull derived from experimental pods with a new Quantic teleport technology that don't need jump drives to travel. Because of this new technology and its small size it can jump directly at any given coordinates even in distant points in a galaxy. It is normally employed ahead of military forces and also for scientific exploration</t>

		<t id="53">HyperDrive Crystal</t>
		<t id="54">This rare crystal is used on the new Hyper Drive technology. It was found at an excavation on Albion's distant system moon, and, although its special properties have been discovered many years ago, only recently the necessary technology was developed to use its quantic properties on jump drives, called Hyper Drives. This new Hyper Drive technology allows ships to jump at any known coordinates on space, galaxy wide. It is being massively used on the actual conflict, leading the actual war to a new strategic level.</t>

	  <t id="56">The Xenon Small Shipyard produces the many fighter vessels that accompany the much larger Xenon Capital ships.</t>-->

		<t id="57">Command Overwatch</t>
		<t id="58">The Overwatch station was designed by the Plutarch Mining Corporation but never saw use in Albion because it was originally outlawed. With the war escalating between Plutarch and the Heart of Albion faction, Martial law has been declared in Albion and the Overwatch station is now seeing wide use. Heart of Albion infiltrators stole the designs and shared them with the Canterans and the Argon government who have also begun to use the Overwatch station as a means of exerting control over important and strategic zones.</t>
